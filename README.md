Resource Rush is a cooperative and educational card game that combines strategy, discussion, and real-world science. Players team up as farmer-scientists to tackle agricultural challenges using NASA's innovative technologies, fostering learning about sustainable agriculture in a fun, engaging way.

## Objective

Resource Rush is a cooperative and educational card game where players, acting as farmer-scientists, collaborate to overcome agricultural challenges over 12 rounds, each representing a month, trying to solve as many challenges as possible by the end of the year. In each turn, an image is revealed, illustrating one or more challenges (such as disasters, e.g., "Storm," or forecasts, e.g., "Drought Risk"). Players must reach a consensus on the challenge represented by the image. Then, one player proposes a solution using resource cards provided by NASA. The team discusses and votes on whether the solution is appropriate, based on real technologies and facts. If approved by the majority, the player who proposed the solution receives an Innovation Award but is prevented from proposing solutions or earning awards on the next turn, only contributing opinions and votes. The goal is to learn about NASA's support for sustainable agriculture while promoting dynamic discussion and collective engagement.

## How a Round Works

1. A player draws a problem card from the problem deck and reveals it to the table.
2. Players analyze the image on the card to reach a consensus on which agricultural problem the image represents.
3. One player reveals two NASA cards and places them on the table.
4. Each player draws one NASA card for themselves.
5. Players consider how the solution they drew can address the problem, and may use the cards on the table to propose a solution.
6. One player proposes a solution to the problem using the available technologies.
7. The other players evaluate whether the proposed solution resolves the problem.
8. Players vote to determine if the solution solves the problem.
9. If it does not solve it, the round continues.
10. If it does, the player receives the award.
11. A new round begins.

## How to Use NASA Data

The 21 NASA cards represent real technologies (e.g., SMAP Satellite, GRACE-FO) and data tools (e.g., Earthdata, Giovanni), available in the center of the table throughout the game. Each card includes a short description, an educational fact, and a link for more information, which players use to support arguments during discussions (e.g., "SMAP maps soil moisture to track droughts"). Players interpret the turn’s image, identify the challenge (e.g., drought, flood), and propose a NASA card as a solution. Voting determines the best choice, and the educational facts teach how these technologies aid real-world agriculture. Links on the cards encourage post-game exploration for deeper learning.

## Target Audience for Resource Rush

|Audience|Description|Age/Level|
|---|---|---|
|**Students**|Ideal for high school and university courses such as science, geography, or environmental education, to learn about NASA technologies.|12+ years|
|**Educators**|A tool for teachers to introduce concepts of sustainable agriculture and applied science in the classroom.|N/A|
|**Families and Casual Groups**|Accessible for players 10+, with simple rules and quick gameplay.|10+ years|
|**Science and Sustainability Enthusiasts**|People interested in NASA innovations and agricultural solutions, no prior knowledge required.|N/A|

## What Resource Rush Teaches

- **NASA Technologies**: How satellites, drones, sensors, and data platforms (e.g., SMAP, Earthdata) solve agricultural challenges like droughts, floods, pests, and erosion.
- **Sustainable Agriculture**: Practices such as efficient irrigation, crop rotation, and soil recovery to ensure food security.
- **Collaboration Skills**: Group decision-making, argumentation, and critical thinking when interpreting images and discussing solutions.
- **Applied Science**: Using Earth observation data for agricultural planning and disaster response, with links to real NASA sources.

## Game Components

|Component|Quantity|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Board**|1|Calendar with 12 spaces (months) and an agricultural health meter (1–10) to track farm progress.|
|**Image Cards**|20|Images representing agricultural challenges (disasters or forecasts, e.g., "Storm," "Drought Risk"), with descriptions and hints to aid interpretation and solution selection.|
|**NASA Cards**|21|Based on real technologies and tools (e.g., SMAP Satellite, Earthdata), including title, short description, educational fact, and link for more information. Placed in the center of the table.|
|**Voting Tokens**|3 per player|Tokens to vote for the best solution each turn.|
|**Innovation Award Tokens**|Varies|Tokens to reward the player who suggested the winning solution.|
|**Agricultural Health Marker**|1|Token for the health meter on the board (starts at 8).|
|**Turn Marker**|1|Indicates the current month on the calendar.|
|**Rulebook**|1|Guide with instructions, turn examples, and explanations of NASA technologies.|

## Scoring

### Collective Goal

Keep agricultural health above 0 after 12 turns. If it is 1 or more, all players win and receive a Farmer-Scientist tier based on the final health level, reflecting the team’s performance in solving challenges with NASA technologies. If it reaches 0, all lose, but can discuss lessons learned about sustainable agriculture and NASA innovations.

|Tier|Final Health|Description|Educational Bonus|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Beginner Farmer-Scientist**|1–3|Narrow victory! The team learned the fundamentals of sustainable agriculture and NASA’s role, overcoming initial obstacles.|Explore a NASA card not used to understand how to prevent future failures.|
|**Intermediate Farmer-Scientist**|4–7|The team managed challenges well, with some mistakes teaching valuable lessons on collaboration and applied science.|Reflect on common errors (e.g., "Why would SMAP be better for droughts than a drone?").|
|**Advanced Farmer-Scientist**|8–12|The team demonstrated mastery in predicting and mitigating disasters, efficiently using NASA solutions.|Discuss how to apply these technologies in real scenarios (e.g., access links on cards for school projects).|

### Individual Scoring

Players earn Innovation Awards (tokens) by suggesting the most-voted solution. At the end, the player with the most awards is the "Innovator of the Year" (honorary title, no impact on collective victory).

### Balance Rule

The winner of a turn cannot propose solutions or earn awards in the next turn but may give opinions and vote, ensuring opportunities for everyone.

## Setup

1. Place the board in the center of the table.
2. Shuffle the Image Cards and NASA Cards.
3. Place all NASA Cards in the center (accessible to all).
4. Distribute 3 Voting Tokens per player.
5. Set the Agricultural Health Marker to 8 on the board.
6. Place the Turn Marker on January.
7. Choose a starting player.

## Game End

After 12 turns, check the final health level to determine victory and tiers. Celebrate wins, reflect on losses, and explore NASA links for extended learning!
