# ResourceRushGame
Resource Rush is a cooperative card game where players act as farmer-scientists, solving agricultural challenges using real NASA technologies. Through teamwork, discussion, and voting, players learn about sustainable agriculture, Earth observation data, and applied science in a fun, interactive way.
